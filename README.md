# Lift-Simulation
Simulation of Lift mechanics using simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript

# Requirements
  1. Have a page where you input the number of floors and lifts from the user
  2. An interactive UI is generated, where we have visual depictions of lifts and buttons on floors
  3. Upon clicking a particular button on the floor, a lift goes to that floor

# Functionality
   - Lift having doors open in 2.5s, then closing in another 2.5s
   - Lift moving at 2s per floor
   - Lift stopping at every floor where it was called
   - Mobile-friendly design
